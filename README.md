# Vrindha-Store_Excel

Vrinda Store project is to create a comprehensive annual sales report and dashboard for the year 2022 (or a similar recent year) to help the store understand its sales performance, analyze marketing strategies, and make data-driven decisions for future growth.

**Data Understanding and Cleaning:**
1. Initial review of the raw data.
2. Identifying and handling missing values (nulls) and duplicate entries.
3. Ensuring data consistency and correct data types.
4. Creating new calculated columns using Excel formulas, such as an "Age Group" column based on the 'Age' column, or converting raw dates into month names.

**Data Analysis with Pivot Tables:**
1. Creating multiple Pivot Tables to summarize the data from different perspectives. This is crucial for answering various business questions.
2. Summarizing sales by month, gender, age group, state, and sales channel.
3. Analyzing order statuses.

**Data Visualization with Charts:**
1. Creating various types of charts from the Pivot Tables to visualize the insights (bar charts for sales by month/channel, pie charts for gender distribution of sales, maps for sales by state).

**Dashboard Creation:**
1. Designing an interactive and user-friendly dashboard on a dedicated Excel sheet.
2. Arranging charts, pivot tables, and KPIs neatly.
3. Implementing Slicers to allow users to dynamically filter the data (by month, gender, state, sales channel) and get immediate insights
